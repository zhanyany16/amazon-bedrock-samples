There are responses from different models completing that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\n \n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\" to answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n\n```\nCatalysts are substances that increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed or altered in the process. They play a crucial role in many chemical processes by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.\n\nThe role of catalysts can be understood by considering the energy profile of a chemical reaction. In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation energy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the strength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\n\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate. They do this by interacting with the reactants and forming intermediate species that require less energy to undergo the necessary bond rearrangements.\n\nThere are two main types of catalysts:\n\n1. Homogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants, typically dissolved in a liquid solution or present as a gas. Examples include enzymes in biological systems and transition metal complexes in organic synthesis.\n\n2. Heterogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in a different phase from the reactants, often solid catalysts interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants. Examples include solid metal catalysts used in petroleum refining, automotive catalytic converters, and industrial processes like the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis.\n\nCatalysts can significantly increase the rate of a chemical reaction, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This makes them essential in various industrial processes, where they improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste generation.\n\nCatalysts are also crucial in biological systems, where enzymes act as highly specific and efficient catalysts for numerous biochemical reactions, enabling life processes to occur at reasonable rates and under mild conditions.\n\nThe development and optimization of catalysts have been a major area of research in chemistry and chemical engineering, as they play a vital role in improving the sustainability, efficiency, and economic viability of many industrial processes, as well as in developing new technologies for energy production, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis.\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the role of catalysts in chemical reactions?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like \"other model or this model\". for example, if a response is in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected model name is model_1.\nDo not add spaces between the selected model name. The selected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <> tags around the model response.\n\n```\nModel responses: \n\n<model_1>\nA catalyst is a substance that can be added to a reaction to increase the reaction rate without getting consumed in the process.
