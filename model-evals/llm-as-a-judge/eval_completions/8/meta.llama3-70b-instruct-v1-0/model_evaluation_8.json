Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\" to answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n\n```\nClassical mechanics and quantum mechanics are two fundamental theories in physics that describe the behavior of particles and systems at different scales and under different conditions.\n\nClassical Mechanics:\nClassical mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion and behavior of macroscopic objects, such as planets, stars, and everyday objects. It is based on the principles of Newtonian mechanics and is governed by Newton's laws of motion, as well as concepts like energy, momentum, and force.\n\nClassical mechanics assumes that particles and objects have well-defined positions and velocities at any given time, and their behavior can be predicted with certainty using deterministic equations of motion. It is a highly successful theory that accurately describes the motion of large-scale objects in everyday situations and has been instrumental in many scientific and technological advancements.\n\nHowever, classical mechanics breaks down when dealing with phenomena at the atomic and subatomic scales, where the effects of quantum mechanics become significant.\n\nQuantum Mechanics:\nQuantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales. It was developed in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that could not be explained by classical mechanics, such as the photoelectric effect, the behavior of atoms and molecules, and the wave-particle duality of matter and energy.\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces several key principles that are fundamentally different from classical mechanics:\n\n1. Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior (wave-particle duality).\n2. The state of a particle is described by a wave function, which represents the probability of finding the particle in a particular state or position.\n3. Particles can only have certain discrete energy levels, rather than a continuous range of energies (quantization of energy).\n4. The act of measurement can affect the state of a particle (the uncertainty principle).\n\nQuantum mechanics has been incredibly successful in explaining and predicting the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales, and it has led to numerous technological advancements, such as lasers, transistors, and quantum computing.\n\nThe main differences between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are:\n\n1. Scale: Classical mechanics applies to macroscopic objects, while quantum mechanics deals with atomic and subatomic scales.\n2. Determinism: Classical mechanics is deterministic, while quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic behavior and uncertainty.\n3. Particle behavior: Classical mechanics treats particles as localized objects, while quantum mechanics describes particles as wave-like entities with probabilistic behavior.\n4. Energy levels: Classical mechanics allows for continuous energy levels, while quantum mechanics introduces quantized energy levels.\n\nWhile classical mechanics remains valid for describing the motion of large-scale objects, quantum mechanics is essential for understanding the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales, and it has revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy.\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like \"other model or this model\". for example, if a response is in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected model name is model_1.\nDo not add spaces between the selected model name. The selected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <> tags around the model response.\n\n```\nModel responses: \n\n<model_1>\nClassical mechanics describes the physics of macroscopic objects and is deterministic, i.e., future is predictable.
