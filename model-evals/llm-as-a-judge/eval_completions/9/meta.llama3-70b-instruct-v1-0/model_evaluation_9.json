There are responses from different models completing that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\n \n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\" to answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n\n```\nIn chemistry, chemical reactions can be classified as either endothermic or exothermic based on the energy changes that occur during the reaction process. The main difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions lies in the direction of energy flow and the temperature changes associated with the reaction.\n\nEndothermic Reactions:\nEndothermic reactions are chemical processes that absorb energy from the surroundings in the form of heat. In an endothermic reaction, the reactants require an input of energy to break existing bonds and form new bonds, resulting in an increase in the overall energy of the system.\n\nEndothermic reactions are characterized by the following:\n\n1. Energy is absorbed from the surroundings, usually in the form of heat.\n2. The temperature of the surroundings decreases as energy is absorbed by the reaction.\n3. The products have a higher energy content than the reactants.\n4. Endothermic reactions are non-spontaneous and require an external energy source to proceed.\n\nExamples of endothermic reactions include:\n- Melting of ice (H2O(s) \u2192 H2O(l))\n- Photosynthesis in plants\n- Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3 \u2192 CaO + CO2)\n\nExothermic Reactions:\nExothermic reactions are chemical processes that release energy to the surroundings in the form of heat. In an exothermic reaction, the reactants have a higher energy content than the products, and the excess energy is released to the surroundings as heat.\n\nExothermic reactions are characterized by the following:\n\n1. Energy is released to the surroundings, usually in the form of heat.\n2. The temperature of the surroundings increases as energy is released by the reaction.\n3. The products have a lower energy content than the reactants.\n4. Exothermic reactions are spontaneous and can occur without an external energy source.\n\nExamples of exothermic reactions include:\n- Combustion reactions (e.g., burning of wood or fossil fuels)\n- Neutralization reactions (e.g., reaction between an acid and a base)\n- Respiration in living organisms\n\nThe difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions is crucial in understanding and controlling chemical processes, as it determines the energy requirements and temperature changes associated with the reaction. Endothermic reactions require an input of energy, while exothermic reactions release energy and can be used as a source of heat or energy. This knowledge is essential in various fields, such as chemistry, materials science, and energy production.\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like \"other model or this model\". for example, if a response is in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected model name is model_1.\nDo not add spaces between the selected model name. The selected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <> tags around the model response.\n\n```\nModel responses: \n\n<model_1>\nIf you touch a container that holds an endothermic process, it will feel cool to the touch. An exothermic process results when heat energy is released, decreasing the internal energy of the system.
