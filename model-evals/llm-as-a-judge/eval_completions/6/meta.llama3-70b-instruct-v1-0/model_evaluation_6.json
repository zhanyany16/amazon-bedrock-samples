Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\n \n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\" to answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n\n```\nThe second law of thermodynamics is one of the fundamental laws of physics that governs the behavior of energy and its transformation in thermodynamic systems. It is closely related to the concept of entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system.\n\nThe second law states that in an isolated system, the total entropy always increases over time, and the process is irreversible. This means that in a closed system, energy tends to disperse and become more disordered, and it is impossible to transfer heat from a cooler object to a hotter object without doing work.\n\nThe mathematical expression of the second law is:\n\n\u0394S \u2265 0\n\nWhere \u0394S is the change in entropy of the system. This inequality indicates that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease; it can only increase or remain constant.\n\nThe concept of entropy is closely tied to the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations or arrangements that a system can have while still appearing the same macroscopically. A system with a higher number of possible microscopic configurations has a higher entropy.\n\nAs a system becomes more disordered or random, its entropy increases. For example, when a gas expands into a larger volume, its molecules become more dispersed and disordered, resulting in an increase in entropy.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics has several important implications:\n\n1. It explains the direction of natural processes: Spontaneous processes in an isolated system always proceed in the direction of increasing entropy, which is the most probable or disordered state.\n\n2. It sets limits on the efficiency of heat engines: The second law dictates that no heat engine can be 100% efficient, as some energy is always lost as waste heat, increasing the overall entropy of the universe.\n\n3. It provides a fundamental basis for the arrow of time: The increase in entropy over time gives a direction to the flow of time, distinguishing the past from the future.\n\n4. It has applications in various fields, such as chemistry, biology, information theory, and cosmology, where the concept of entropy is used to understand the behavior of complex systems.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy are crucial for understanding the behavior of energy and matter in the universe, as well as the limitations and efficiency of various processes and systems.\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the second law of thermodynamics and how does it relate to entropy?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below.
