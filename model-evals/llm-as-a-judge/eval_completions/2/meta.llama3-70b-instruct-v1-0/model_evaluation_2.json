Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\n \n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\" to answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n\n```\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, trap heat from the Sun's radiation and prevent it from escaping back into space. This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth, as without it, the planet's average surface temperature would be around -18\u00b0C (-0.4\u00b0F), which is too cold for most life forms to survive.\n\nThe primary greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of thermal energy emitted by the Earth's surface after being heated by the Sun's visible and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe greenhouse effect works as follows:\n\n1. The Sun's radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface.\n\n2. The Earth's surface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation (thermal energy).\n\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a portion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface.\n\n4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.\n\nWhile the greenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth's average surface temperature to rise, leading to global warming and climate change.\n\nThe consequences of global warming include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food production.\n\nAddressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry. International cooperation and collective action are crucial to mitigating the effects of global warming and ensuring a sustainable future for our planet.\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the greenhouse effect and how does it contribute to global warming?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below.
