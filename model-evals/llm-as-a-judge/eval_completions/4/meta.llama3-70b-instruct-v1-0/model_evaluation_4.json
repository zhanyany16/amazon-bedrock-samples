Thomson suggested that atoms were composed of a uniform positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within it. However, this model was challenged by the famous Rutherford gold foil experiment in 1911, where Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the guidance of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a thin gold foil with alpha particles.\n\nThe results of the Rutherford experiment showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, while a few were deflected at large angles, which was unexpected according to the plum pudding model. Rutherford proposed a new model, known as the Rutherford atomic model or the planetary model, which suggested that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it, similar to planets orbiting the Sun.\n\nWhile the Rutherford model was a significant improvement, it still had limitations and could not explain the stability of atoms or the emission spectra of different elements. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom, known as the Bohr model, which incorporated quantum theory and the concept of quantized energy levels.\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, electrons can only occupy specific energy levels or orbits around the nucleus, and they can move between these levels by absorbing or emitting specific amounts of energy in the form of photons. This model successfully explained the emission spectra of hydrogen and other simple atoms.\n\nHowever, the Bohr model had limitations in explaining the behavior of more complex atoms and molecules. In the 1920s, the development of quantum mechanics by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Werner Heisenberg, and others provided a more comprehensive understanding of the structure and behavior of atoms.\n\nThe quantum mechanical model of the atom describes electrons as existing in probability clouds or orbitals around the nucleus, rather than in well-defined orbits. The shape and energy of these orbitals are determined by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the specific atom or molecule.\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the structure of the atom and how was it determined?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below.
