There are responses from different models completing that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\n \n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\" to answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n\n```\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. This principle arises from the wave-particle duality of quantum particles and has profound implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic scales\n```\n\nQuestion: What is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?\n\nAssistant:\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like \"other model or this model\". for example, if a response is in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected model name is model_1.\nDo not add spaces between the selected model name. The selected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <> tags around the model response.\n\n```\nModel responses: \n\n<model_1>\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be measured precisely at the same time, reflecting the wave-particle duality of quantum particles.\n</model_1>\n\n\n<anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0>\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously.
