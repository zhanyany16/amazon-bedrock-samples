Use the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by "```" and the question related to that task below it. There are responses from different models completing that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.
Put the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: "best_match_answer" (which contains the full answer you select), "selected_model" (which contains the model name), and "explanation". 
Your explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy "explanation". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.

```
{context}
```

Refer to the question demarcated by "```" below

```
Question: {question}
```

Refer to the model completions demarcated by "```" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like "other model or this model". for example, if a response is in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected model name is model_1.
Do not add spaces between the selected model name. The selected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <> tags around the model response.

```
Model responses: 

<model_1>
{original_answer}
</model_1>

{model_responses}
```

Only give the JSON format response and do not include any pre filler words. Make sure your JSON response is a single line with the opening and closing brackets placed correctly. Only select from the models provided, do not make up your own model. If none give a good answer, select the one which is better.

Your response should start with the JSON directly and should only contain that, no pre filler words or tags.
