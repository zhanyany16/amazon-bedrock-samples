    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum no. of results\n",
    "The maximum number of results option gives you control over the number of search results to be retrieved from the vector store and passed to the FM for generating the answer. This allows you to customize the amount of background information provided for generation, thereby giving more context for complex questions or less for simpler questions. It allows you to fetch up to 100 results. This option helps improve the likelihood of relevant context, thereby improving the accuracy and reducing the hallucination of the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the custom knowledge base prompt template allows you to replace the default prompt template with your own to customize the prompt that’s sent to the model for response generation. This allows you to customize the tone, output format, and behavior of the FM when it responds to a user’s question. With this option, you can fine-tune terminology to better match your industry or domain (such as healthcare or legal). Additionally, you can add custom instructions and examples tailored to your specific workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- You are going to use ```RetrieveAndGenerate``` API to illustrate the differences before and after utilizing the features. This API converts queries into embeddings, searches the knowledge base, and then augments the foundation model prompt with the search results as context information and returns the FM-generated response to the question. The output of the ```RetrieveAndGenerate``` API includes the generated response, source attribution as well as the retrieved text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this module, we will use the Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku model as our FM to work with the max no. of results and prompt customization features"
